# 0x08. Networking basics #1

<div style="text-align: justify">

Thank you for visiting this repository which contain my work about to introducing networking concepts. In this project, I drawed some diagrams covering the web stack that i built with the sysadmin/devops track projects.

> [0-simple_web_stack.jpg](https://github.com/Imanolasolo/holberton-system_engineering-devops/blob/main/0x07-networking_basics/README.md) ---> Design of one server web infrastructure that hosts the website that is reachable via www.foobar.com. 

>[0-simple_web_stack.md](https://github.com/Imanolasolo/holberton-system_engineering-devops/blob/main/0x07-networking_basics/1-types_of_network) ---> Extended explanation about one server web infrastructure that hosts the website that is reachable via www.foobar.com.

You must be able to explain some specifics about this infrastructure:

- What is a server

- What is the role of the domain name

- What type of DNS record www is in www.foobar.com

- What is the role of the web server

- What is the role of the application server

- What is the role of the database

- What is the server using to communicate with the computer of the user requesting the website

You must be able to explain what the issues are with this infrastructure:

- SPOF

- Downtime when maintenance needed (like deploying new code web server needs to be restarted)

- Cannot scale if too much incoming traffic

>[1-distributed_web_infrastructure](https://github.com/Imanolasolo/holberton-system_engineering-devops/blob/main/0x07-networking_basics/2-MAC_and_IP_address) ---> File where web direction of design is allocated.

>[1-distributed_web_infrastructure.png]() --> Design of a three server web infrastructure that hosts the website www.foobar.com.

>[1-distributed_web_infrastructure.md]() --> Extended explanation about three server web infrastructure that hosts the website www.foobar.com.

You must be able to explain some specifics about this infrastructure:

- For every additional element, why you are adding it

- What distribution algorithm your load balancer is configured with and how it works

- Is your load-balancer enabling an Active-Active or Active-Passive setup, explain the difference between both

- How a database Primary-Replica (Master-Slave) cluster works

- What is the difference between the Primary node and the Replica node in regard to the application

You must be able to explain what the issues are with this infrastructure:

- Where are SPOF

- Security issues (no firewall, no HTTPS)

- No monitoring

>[2-secured_and_monitored_web_infrastructure]() --> File where web direction of design is allocated.

>[2-secured_and_monitored_web_infrastructure.png]() --> Design of a three server web infrastructure that hosts the website www.foobar.com, it must be secured, serve encrypted traffic, and be monitored.

>[2-secured_and_monitored_web_infrastructure.md]() --> Extended explanation about three server web infrastructure that hosts the website www.foobar.com, it must be secured, serve encrypted traffic, and be monitored.

You must be able to explain some specifics about this infrastructure:

- For every additional element, why you are adding it

- What are firewalls for

- Why is the traffic served over HTTPS

- What monitoring is used for

- How the monitoring tool is collecting data

- Explain what to do if you want to monitor your web server QPS

You must be able to explain what the issues are with this infrastructure:

- Why terminating SSL at the load balancer level is an issue

- Why having only one MySQL server capable of accepting writes is an issue

- Why having servers with all the same components (database, web server and application server) might be a problem
