> [0-what-is-my-pid](https://github.com/Imanolasolo/holberton-system_engineering-devops/blob/main/0x05-processes_and_signals/0-what-is-my-pid) --> Bash script that displays its own PID.

> [README.md](https://github.com/Imanolasolo/holberton-system_engineering-devops/blob/main/0x05-processes_and_signals/README.md) ---> README file to show the project insights. 

>[1-list_your_processes](https://github.com/Imanolasolo/holberton-system_engineering-devops/blob/main/0x05-processes_and_signals/1-list_your_processes) ---> Bash script that displays a list of currently running processes.

>[2-show_your_bash_pid](https://github.com/Imanolasolo/holberton-system_engineering-devops/blob/main/0x05-processes_and_signals/2-show_your_bash_pid) ---> Bash script that displays lines containing the bash word, thus allowing you to easily get the PID of your Bash process.

>[3-show_your_bash_pid_made_easy](https://github.com/Imanolasolo/holberton-system_engineering-devops/blob/main/0x05-processes_and_signals/3-show_your_bash_pid_made_easy) --> Bash script that displays the PID, along with the process name, of processes whose name contain the word bash.

>[4-to_infinity_and_beyond](https://github.com/Imanolasolo/holberton-system_engineering-devops/blob/main/0x05-processes_and_signals/4-to_infinity_and_beyond) --> Bash script that displays To infinity and beyond indefinitely.

>[5-dont_stop_me_now](https://github.com/Imanolasolo/holberton-system_engineering-devops/blob/main/0x05-processes_and_signals/5-dont_stop_me_now) --> Bash script that stops 4-to_infinity_and_beyond process.

>[6-stop_me_if_you_can](https://github.com/Imanolasolo/holberton-system_engineering-devops/blob/main/0x05-processes_and_signals/6-stop_me_if_you_can) --> Bash script that stops 4-to_infinity_and_beyond process.

>[7-highlander](https://github.com/Imanolasolo/holberton-system_engineering-devops/blob/main/0x05-processes_and_signals/7-highlander) --> Bash script that displays:

To infinity and beyond indefinitely

With a sleep 2 in between each iteration

I am invincible!!! when receiving a SIGTERM signal

>[8-beheaded_process](https://github.com/Imanolasolo/holberton-system_engineering-devops/blob/main/0x05-processes_and_signals/8-beheaded_process) --> Bash script that kills the process 7-highlander.

>[100-process_and_pid_file](https://github.com/Imanolasolo/holberton-system_engineering-devops/blob/main/0x05-processes_and_signals/100-process_and_pid_file) -->  Bash script that:

Creates the file /var/run/myscript.pid containing its PID

Displays To infinity and beyond indefinitely

Displays I hate the kill command when receiving a SIGTERM signal

Displays Y U no love me?! when receiving a SIGINT signal

Deletes the file /var/run/myscript.pid and terminates itself when receiving a SIGQUIT or SIGTERM signal

>[101-manage_my_process, manage_my_process](https://github.com/Imanolasolo/holberton-system_engineering-devops/blob/main/0x05-processes_and_signals/101-manage_my_process) --> manage_my_process Bash script that:

Indefinitely writes I am alive! to the file /tmp/my_process

In between every I am alive! message, the program should pause for 2 seconds

Write Bash (init) script 101-manage_my_process that manages manage_my_process. (both files need to be

pushed to git)

>[102-zombie.c](https://github.com/Imanolasolo/holberton-system_engineering-devops/blob/main/0x05-processes_and_signals/102-zombie.c) --> C program that creates 5 zombie processes.
